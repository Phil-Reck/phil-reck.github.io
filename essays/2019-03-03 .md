Technology is playing a vital role in the transitioning of Africa's economy. A team of experts from different African countries says "Only technological development holds the key to the much desired transformation in Africa". Software development in Africa, despite it's slow start, is now speeding up and tech communities across are on the forefront to make the transition as smooth as possible.

Most developers just love the idea of being self made, we love getting lost in being the kind of people who pull themselves up by their own and hustle our way to the top with no help from anyone. It's an appealing idea but it's completely flawed and completely false. As a developer, you need to come to terms with the truth, that we all need support and surround ourselves with like minded people.

So here are ways community prove to be the solution towards growth:

Being part of a community gives you a chance to learn from the overall group, mining the wisdom of several people and helping each other out along the way. You can create a very good connection of trusted peers who give each other advice and feedback. It's what every developers needs.

Coming together with like minded people means that you have an increased chance of meeting someone who is likely willing to take you under their wings and mentor you and give you the benefits of their experience. This is a huge advantage because they will help you avoid very costly mistakes that could drag your progress behind.




> Its always good to have a helping hand at the start. No matter how incredibly smart you think you are, or how brilliant, disruptive or plain-off the wall, your new concept might be, every start-up team needs at-least a good mentor

Community by their nature, contain a diversity of opinions, ideas and knowledge that you will never encounter alone. Just being in vicinity means that you are constantly challenging yourself to think creatively and reconsider your know how. It is in a huge way an opportunity to improve your professional and personal network. Connecting in a community opens new doors, from getting recruiters about job opportunities, to getting noticed by people who would like to work with you in a freelance basis, you never know where an opportunity that can advance your career will present itself. It's important to understand that opportunities not only present themselves in form of new jobs, but they can also mean meeting an important person in the industry that can change your career or being given a chance to start your own business,

It's the reason why founding teams are more likely to succeed in this than the solo developers. There will just be certain areas and skills that you don't have or aren't good enough that might hold you back from achieving your goals.

What a community of like-minded people provides, more than anything else, is a support network of people who are going through the exact same journey as you.

Even if theyâ€™re at different stages of the journey, theyâ€™ll understand what it is youâ€™re going through and be able to give you the support you need to keep going.

Being a developer is more than just having the right tools to get a started. It takes a lot of mental and emotional energy, and having someone, let alone a whole group of people, to talk to about your journey can be all you need to keep plowing ahead.
