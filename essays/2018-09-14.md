"Africa is home to 200 million young people, soon to be the largest working age population in the world. Less than a third will graduate from high school and only 12% will get any sort of tertiary education.

At the same time, Africa’s billion people are getting online faster than you can say “hit me on Whatsapp.” The number of Nigerians on Facebook doubles every quarter. Kenya has one of the highest tweeting populations in the world.

So who is going to build Africa’s digital economy? It has to be Africans, because they know what the rising consumer class wants and what problems need to be solved. They also know how to solve them, once they have the tools. And at the moment, far too few do." -CEO and CO-Founder of codex Elizabeth Gould

Technology is the tool that will help Africa grow to it's full potential and I'm going to tell you why.

Right now mobile banking is improving how we do businesses, deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services easily with a mobile device for example Mpesa the largest mobile operator in Kenya, has more than 24 million users across Africa with 10 countries in Africa using it. Jara mobile limited a start up in Nigeria that runs an innovative bill payment platform that integrates various retailers into one loyalty program giving customer a motivation of doing more with less money. This has rolled out a number of financial services such as credit and insurance out of the market allowing people to better manage financial risks.

According to Africa Tech Start up funding report. South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya accounted for the majority of the funding, with South Africa leading the way in terms of startups with 59, while Nigeria had 30 and Kenya 24. Companies like Andela, Moringa, Twiga and CodeX whose core mission is to invests in Africa’s most talented software engineers to help companies solve the technical talent shortage.

In June 2018 Google launched a program across SubSahara Africa called Developer Student Clubs designed to help students across African Campuses build their mobile and web development skills and knowledge which is part of Google’s commitment to provide mobile developer training to 100,000 Africans to develop world-class apps in the next 5 years.

I personally am looking forward to startup companies like Mindojo across Africa that will help kids attain their maximum potential in classroom"Mindojo [is] developing interactive algorithms that will not only teach me math, physics and history, but will simultaneously study me and get to know exactly who I am. Digital teachers will closely monitor every answer I give, and how long it took me to give it. Over time they will discern my unique weaknesses as well as my strengths and will identify what gets me excited and what makes my eyelids droop. They could teach me thermodynamics or geometry in a way that suits my personality type, even if that particular method doesn’t suit 99% of the other pupils.” Yuval Noah Harari.

I believe technology will give room for better and improved medical conditions across our continent. In Yuval Noah Harari's book Homo Deus, A brief History of Tomorrow he says "technology might prove easier to replace doctors specializing in a relatively narrow field such as cancer diagnosis" He goes ahead and gives an example of a recent experiment computer algorithm diagnosed 90 percent of lung cancer presented to it while human doctors had a success rate of 50 percent. In fact I believe the future is here.

I believe technology is here to make our continent reach it's best potential and we are the one's to keep the ball rolling. Let's give youths tools to solve community's problem instead of wasting their lives with drugs out there and spending much time online doing nothing. Let's wake up to the call that the future is here and it demands our combined effort to breath life to it.
